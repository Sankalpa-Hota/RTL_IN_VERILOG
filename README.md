What to Learn in each of the codes :
1) DFF -> Async Reset , Sequential logic
2) TB_DFF -> How to use for loop ( needs ( ; ; )) in Simulation - Generate/Genvar , create and call function , set the clock , instantiate , Store Prev Value in Register, Display , delay #
3) Router -> Case statements , Combinatorial logic
4) Second best -> Synchronous reset , if , else if , comparators , assign statement usage outside always block
5) Rounding division -> Assign in combinatorial , For , Bit indexing , genvar and generate in combinatorial
6) Edge Detected -> Learn about how to generate a pulse , write a synchronous delay , Also how to delay instructions - use additional reg
7) PISO => Left and Right Shift , PISO Architecture , Buffer design and use
8) SIPO => LEft shift
9) FIBONACCI => Understand how the non blocking works , Curr = curr + prev and prev = curr in same cycle.
10) Count 1 => Logic building (Use of AND to get the 1's) and FOR loop in combinatorial
